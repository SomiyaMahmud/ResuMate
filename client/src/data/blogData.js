            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Your resume is your first impression. In today's competitive job market, a generic resume simply won't cut it. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to create a document that not only lists your experience but tells your professional story.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Choose the Right Format</h3>
            <p>There are three main resume formats: Chronological, Functional, and Hybrid. For most professionals, the <strong>Reverse-Chronological</strong> format is best, as it highlights your most recent achievements first.</p>

            <h3>2. The Header</h3>
            <p>Keep it clean. Name, phone number, email, and LinkedIn profile. Avoid full addresses; city and state are sufficient.</p>

            <h3>3. The Summary Statement</h3>
            <p>Ditch the "Objective" statement. Instead, use a "Professional Summary" that creates a hook. In 2-3 sentences, highlight your years of experience, key skills, and biggest professional achievement.</p>

            <h3>4. Experience Section</h3>
            <p>Focus on achievements, not just duties. Use action verbs like "Spearheaded," "Developed," and "Increased." Quantify your results whenever possible (e.g., "Increased sales by 20%").</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Proofread, proofread, proofread. A single typo can send your resume to the "no" pile. Good luck!</p>

            <h3>1. Typographical Errors</h3>
            <p>It sounds obvious, but 58% of resumes contain typos. Use disjointed tools like Grammarly, but always do a manual read-through.</p>

            <h3>2. One Page? Two Pages?</h3>
            <p>Don't cram everything onto one page if you have 10 years of experience. Conversely, don't use two pages if you're a fresh graduate. Content relevance dictates length.</p>

            <h3>3. Passive Voice</h3>
            <p>Avoid "Was responsible for..." Use "Managed," "Led," or "Executed" instead.</p>

            <h3>4. Generic Templates</h3>
            <p>Using a template that 10,000 other people have used makes you look uninspired. Customize your layout slightly to show personality.</p>

            <h3>5. Including a Photo</h3>
            <p>Unless you are an actor or model, or applying in a country where it is customary (like parts of Europe or Asia), specialized advice suggests leaving the photo off to avoid bias.</p>

            <h3>6. Irrelevant Hobbies</h3>
            <p>Unless "Underwater Basket Weaving" proves you have manual dexterity needed for surgery, leave it out. Focus on hobbies that show leadership or relevant skills.</p>

            <h3>7. Ignoring Keywords</h3>
            <p>Failing to tailor your resume with keywords from the job description can lead to automatic rejection by ATS. Always customize your resume for the specific role.</p>

            <h3>8. Unprofessional Email Addresses</h3>
            <p>Using an email like "partyguy99@email.com" looks unprofessional. Stick to a simple format like "firstname.lastname@email.com".</p>

            <h3>9. Including Personal Information</h3>
            <p>Details like age, marital status, religion, or social security number are irrelevant and can lead to unconscious bias (or identity theft). Keep it professional.</p>

            <h3>10. Listing Duties Instead of Achievements</h3>
            <p>Employers want to know what you accomplished, not just what you were responsible for. Focus on the impact you made in your previous roles.</p>

            <h3>The 6-Second Scan</h3>
            <p>Studies show recruiters spend an average of 6 seconds on a resume before deciding ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. They look for: Job Title, Company, Start/End Dates, and Education.</p>

            <h3>Keywords are King</h3>
            <p>HR often uses Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). If your resume lacks the specific keywords from the job description, no human will ever see it. Tailor your resume for every single application.</p>

            <h3>Career Progression</h3>
            <p>They want to see growth. Did you move from Junior to Senior? Did you take on more responsibility? If your title stayed the same for 5 years, show how your duties expanded.</p>

            <h3>Gaps in Employment</h3>
            <p>Be prepared to explain them, but don't hide them. A gap year for travel or caretaking is acceptable if framed correctly as a period of personal growth or necessary commitment.</p>

            <h3>Skills First</h3>
            <p>In tech, skills pay the bills. Group them logically: Languages (Java, Python), Frameworks (React, Spring), Tools (Docker, AWS). Put this section near the top.</p>

            <h3>Project Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Links to GitHub represent your actual ability. Highlight 2-3 key projects. Explain the <strong>Problem</strong>, the <strong>Solution</strong> you built, and the <strong>Impact</strong> it had.</p>

            <h3>Contribution to Open Source</h3>
            <p>If you contribute to open source, list it. It shows passion for coding beyond the 9-to-5.</p>

            <h3>Don't Just List Technologies</h3>
            <p>Don't just say "Used React." Say "Built a responsive dashboard using React and Redux that reduced load times by 40%." Context matters.</p>

            <h3>Show, Don't Just Tell</h3>
            <p>Your resume itself is a design piece. Use it to demonstrate your typography and layout skills. However, ensure it remains legible.</p>

            <h3>Link Your Portfolio</h3>
            <p>Your portfolio is more important than your resume. Make the link prominent. Ensure the URL is live and the site is mobile-friendly.</p>

            <h3>Two Versions</h3>
            <p>Have a "Creative" PDF version for emailing directly to Art Directors, and a "Text-Based" Word version for submitting to online portals (ATS systems often choke on complex vector graphics).</p>

            <h3>Software Proficiency</h3>
            <p>Rate your skills honestly. Don't put "Expert" in Photoshop if you can't mask hair properly. Use visual bars or simple lists.</p>
